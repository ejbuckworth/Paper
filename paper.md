#Introduction
We present timings of Pepper's wake up times throughout the day the 18/11/25. 
We timed the wake ups using a standard stopwatch (Bloggs et al.)
Previous studies (Jones et al.) used a digital watch but we didn't have one.
This work is undertaken so that we no how frequently old dogs wake up over 24 hours.

#Simulations
We simulate the body clock of the dog using... 

#Methodology.
We followed the established methodology of (Xu et al.)

#Results 

Think I must've added the results to the wrong place.

# Conclusions

This seems to be working overall.
