#Introduction
We present timings of Pepper's wake up times throughout the day the 18/11/25. 
We timed the wake ups using a standard stopwatch (Bloggs et al.)
Previous studies (Jones et al.) used a digital watch but we didn't have one.
This work is undertaken so that we no how frequently old dogs wake up over 24 hours.
